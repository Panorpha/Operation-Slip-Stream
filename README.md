## Operation Convect Slip Stream Instructions: ##

In order to install this as a multiplayer mission file locally on your machine, go to ```C:\Users\yourUser\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\playerName\mpmissions``` and clone the files to this directory. Ensure that you also have the root folder attached to this commit, being the Operation Convect folder, else you will not be able to access this mission file.

This mission is designed for "MilSim" Co-Operative game play. Loadouts and roles have been setup for the ZSU community, though with small alterations theres a great template for all to use. Feel free to use at your hearts content, though please simply acknowledge my name somewhere within the files.

Many thanks and enjoy,
Panorpha
